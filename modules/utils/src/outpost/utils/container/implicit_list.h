/**
 * Static single linked list.
 *
 * TODO example
 *
 * This implementation relies for the \c next member on the fact that
 * zero-initialized static variables are initialized before any constructor
 * is called.
 *
 * See chapter 3.6.2 of the C++03 standard:
 *
 *     Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be
 *     zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization
 *     takes place. Zero-initialization and initialization with a
 *     constant expression are collectively called static
 *     initialization; all other initialization is dynamic
 *     initialization. Objects of POD types (3.9) with static storage
 *     duration initialized with constant expressions (5.19) shall be
 *     initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place.
 *
 * This does only apply to static member variables of classes and
 * global variables.
