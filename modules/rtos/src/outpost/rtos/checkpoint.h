 * Checkpoint at which threads can be suspended or resumed.

 * Directly suspending or resuming threads is very dangerous because it can
 * very easily lead to deadlocks. This checkpoint class provides an alternative
 * based on semaphores.
 *
 * Threads can be suspended at a checkpoint until they are needed again. The
 * use of this checkpoint class allows to properly release resources before
 * suspending the thread.
