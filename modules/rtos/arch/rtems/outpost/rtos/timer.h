 * Software timer.
 *
 * The timer callback functions are called in the context of the
 * timer server thread.
 *
 * The Timer Server thread is responsible for executing the timer
 * service routines associated with all task-based timers.
 *
 * The Timer Server is designed to remain blocked until a task-based
 * timer fires. This reduces the execution overhead of the Timer Server.
 *
 * \warning    You need to call Timer::startTimerDaemonThread() somewhere
 *             in your start-up code. Otherwise the timers won't work!
